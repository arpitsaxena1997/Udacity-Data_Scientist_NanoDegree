## Project Motivation and Purpose <a name="motivation"></a>
I have curiosity of knowing about the business and costumer trends. The ability to predict the behavior of the costumers is the biggest super-power a business can have. With the right data and use of proper data science techniques, this can be achieved. This project is about predicting costumers' behavior.

In this project we will try to find out what is the likelihood of a costumer to unsubscribe or to stay on the fictious music streaming app ‘Sparkify’.

The main crux of the project is to extract from behavioral data and implement it to predict their decision to stay or leave(churn).
In simple words, this project is a calssification project, in which we classify users between who are likely churn and who who are not.
